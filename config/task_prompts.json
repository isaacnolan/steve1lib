It is BETTER to overestimate the number of steps needed than to underestimate, as underestimation can cause actions to be interrupted prematurely.\n\nExample (for n=480):\nmove_forward: 5\nDig hole, gather dirt, mine dirt:240\nJump Up, Look Down, Place block Under: 235\n\nReasoning: First move forward to collect dirt (5 steps ≈ 0.17s), Dig hole to collect dirt (240 steps ≈ 8s), position ourselves correctly, then place blocks to build the tower upward (6 total placement steps ≈ 0.2s).\nTotal steps: 5 + 240 + 235 = 480 steps (≈ 16 seconds)\nYou will get a chance to replan every {n} steps so you don't have to finish the entire task in this chunk.",
